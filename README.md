# MemoryFlipCard

## Description

Memory flip card game. 
HOW TO PLAY:
Player chooses a card from the board then chooses a second card to find a match.
If Player does not find a match, the player will be alerted.  Player are to click "ok",
which will turn the cards back over to its back side.  Player then chooses two cards again
until they have found a match.  When a match is found, player will be alerted.  Click "ok"
and the matched cards will be removed from the board. When all matches are found, all cards 
are removed from the board.  To play again, player must click on the "reset" button.

UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS:
I was not able to convert to two player.  

The score has not been set.

The "start" button was removed as the code already sets the cards on the board. 
I was working on trying to figure out how to have the cards set on the click of a "start" button 
as opposed to automatic on game load.

Removed the "score" and "player" from the game board after realizing my set up made it 
run over the "reset" button when viewing from a smart phone.  This tells me I should have used 
flexbox set up so they would not run over one another.

Attempted a video background, but I was not able to set it behind the gameboard itself.  The "player" 
and "score" were the only elements that would appear in front of the video.  I was not able to figure 
this one out.


Design:
The design for the game is personal.  The best thing about this game is that one 
chooses whatever images they'd like for the game cards.  I designed this game with my mother 
in mind.  As she is struggling with Alzheimer, I designed the game around her using 
familiar images such as family as well as colors and fonts that would be easier on the eyes.
